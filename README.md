üìß Spam Email Detection using Scikit-learn

üß† Project Overview

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning model implementation for spam email detection using Python and Scikit-learn. It showcases the use of the Naive Bayes algorithm and Bag-of-Words (CountVectorizer) to classify messages as either spam or not spam.

The goal is to provide a clear and simple example of how text classification can be implemented in a predictive model.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook



---

üìÇ Dataset

A small, manually-defined dataset is used in this demo consisting of simple messages labeled as:

1 = Spam

0 = Not Spam


You can easily scale this model using a larger dataset such as the SMS Spam Collection Dataset.


---

üîç Model Details

Text Vectorization: CountVectorizer converts text messages into numerical feature vectors.

Classifier: MultinomialNB (Naive Bayes) is used for training the model.

Prediction: The model predicts whether a new input message is spam or not.



---

üìà Implementation Steps

1. Prepare labeled training data (spam and not spam).


2. Convert text data to numerical form using CountVectorizer.


3. Train a MultinomialNB model using the vectorized data.


4. Use the trained model to predict the class of a new message.

üìì Deliverable

The main deliverable is a Jupyter Notebook that contains:

Model training

Message prediction

Code explanation and comments

üìå Future Improvements

Use a larger and real-world dataset

Add performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)

Include data preprocessing (stop words removal, stemming)

Explore other models like Logistic Regression or SVM
